# Forgot Password Implementation Guide

## Overview
The forgot password functionality has been implemented using Firebase's built-in password reset system, which provides a secure and reliable way to reset user passwords.

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. **User clicks "Forgot Password?"** on the login page
2. **User enters email address** on the forgot password page
3. **System sends reset email** using Firebase's `sendPasswordResetEmail()`
4. **User receives email** with a secure reset link
5. **User clicks link** and is redirected to Firebase's password reset page
6. **User sets new password** on Firebase's secure page
7. **User returns to app** and logs in with new password

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `services/forgotPasswordService.js` - Core password reset logic
- `app/forgotpassword.tsx` - Forgot password UI page
- `app/login.tsx` - Updated to link to forgot password page

#### Key Functions:

##### `initiatePasswordReset(email)`
- Uses Firebase's `sendPasswordResetEmail()` function
- Sends a secure password reset link to the user's email
- Handles Firebase authentication errors gracefully

##### `sendVerificationCode(email)` (Alternative Implementation)
- Generates a 6-digit verification code
- Stores code in Firestore with expiration (10 minutes)
- Provides attempt limiting (3 attempts max)
- Includes development mode with visible codes

##### `verifyCode(email, code)`
- Validates the entered verification code
- Checks expiration and attempt limits
- Cleans up expired codes automatically

##### `resetPassword(email, newPassword, code)`
- Verifies code before allowing password reset
- Cleans up verification data after successful reset
- Provides comprehensive error handling

### 3. Security Features

#### Built-in Security:
- **Firebase Authentication**: Uses Google's secure authentication system
- **Secure Links**: Password reset links are cryptographically secure
- **Time-limited**: Reset links expire automatically
- **One-time Use**: Reset links can only be used once

#### Custom Security (Alternative Implementation):
- **Code Expiration**: Verification codes expire after 10 minutes
- **Attempt Limiting**: Maximum 3 attempts per code
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired codes are automatically removed
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation

### 4. User Experience

#### Simple Flow:
- **One-step process**: User just needs to enter email
- **Clear instructions**: Step-by-step guidance provided
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error messages
- **Visual feedback**: Loading states and success indicators

#### Alternative Multi-step Flow:
- **Step 1**: Enter email address
- **Step 2**: Enter verification code
- **Step 3**: Set new password
- **Resend functionality**: Users can request new codes
- **Countdown timer**: Shows when resend is available

### 5. Error Handling

#### Firebase Errors:
- `auth/user-not-found`: "No account found with this email address"
- `auth/invalid-email`: "Invalid email address"
- `auth/too-many-requests`: "Too many requests. Please try again later"

#### Custom Errors:
- Code expiration: "Verification code has expired"
- Invalid code: "Invalid code. X attempts remaining"
- Too many attempts: "Too many incorrect attempts"

### 6. Production Considerations

#### Email Service Integration:
For production use, consider integrating with:
- **SendGrid**: Professional email delivery
- **Mailgun**: Reliable email service
- **AWS SES**: Amazon's email service
- **Firebase Extensions**: Pre-built email solutions

#### Custom Email Templates:
- Branded email templates
- Custom reset links
- Multi-language support
- Mobile-optimized emails

### 7. Testing

#### Development Testing:
- Verification codes are logged to console
- Test with different email addresses
- Verify error handling scenarios
- Test expiration and cleanup

#### Production Testing:
- Test with real email addresses
- Verify email delivery
- Test reset link functionality
- Monitor error rates

### 8. Future Enhancements

#### Possible Improvements:
- **SMS Verification**: Add phone number verification
- **Security Questions**: Additional security layer
- **Account Recovery**: Multiple recovery methods
- **Audit Logging**: Track password reset attempts
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse

## Usage

### For Users:
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter email address
4. Check email for reset link
5. Follow instructions in email
6. Return to app and login

### For Developers:
```javascript
// Import the service
import { initiatePasswordReset } from '../services/forgotPasswordService';

// Use in component
const handleForgotPassword = async (email) => {
  try {
    await initiatePasswordReset(email);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

## Security Notes

- Firebase handles all security aspects of password reset
- Reset links are cryptographically secure
- No passwords are stored or transmitted in plain text
- Automatic expiration prevents link reuse
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

This implementation provides a secure, user-friendly password reset system that follows industry best practices and integrates seamlessly with Firebase Authentication.
